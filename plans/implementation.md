# Implementation Plan: BirdSong ID

## Why This Approach

We're using a feature-focused vertical slice approach with iterative phases because:

1. The existing codebase already has UI components and routing in place
2. We need to integrate new functionality into existing components
3. Each phase builds on previous work while remaining functional
4. Testing can be done end-to-end after each phase

## Phase 1: Audio Recording Core (Frontend)

- [x] Basic UI components and routing (already implemented)
- [x] Implement audio capture in RecordButton component
  - Connect MediaRecorder API
  - Add recording state management
  - Implement start/stop functionality
- [x] Add audio visualization during recording
- [x] Implement temporary audio storage

## Phase 2: Backend API Setup

- [x] Set up Express routes for audio classification
  - POST /api/classify endpoint
  - File upload handling with multer
- [x] Implement Edge Impulse API integration
  - Audio format validation
  - Secure API key handling
  - Error handling
- [x] Add CORS configuration
- [ ] Test API endpoints with sample audio

## Phase 3: Bird Database Setup

- [ ] Set up MongoDB integration
  - Install mongoose
  - Create bird schema
  - Set up connection handling
- [ ] Create bird data management endpoints
  - GET /api/birds - List all birds
  - GET /api/birds/:id - Get bird details
  - POST /api/birds - Add new bird (admin)
  - PUT /api/birds/:id - Update bird info (admin)
- [ ] Create initial data migration
  - Bird species details
  - Sample recordings
  - Image references
- [ ] Add caching layer for frequently accessed data
  - Redis for API response caching
  - Local storage sync for offline data
- [ ] Implement recognition tracking
  - Update recognitionCount after successful classification
  - Add endpoint to get most frequently recognized birds

## Phase 4: Frontend-Backend Integration

- [ ] Add API service in frontend
  - Implement audio upload function
  - Add error handling
  - Add loading states
- [ ] Connect RecordButton to backend API
- [ ] Enhance ResultsPage component to display API responses
- [ ] Implement retry mechanism for failed uploads

## Phase 5: Enhanced Features

- [ ] Add audio playback of recorded sound
- [ ] Implement local storage for recent identifications
- [ ] Add history viewing functionality
- [ ] Enhance error messages and user feedback

## Phase 6: Polish & Optimization

- [ ] Optimize audio processing
- [ ] Add loading animations and transitions
- [ ] Implement proper error boundaries
- [ ] Add offline capability warning
- [ ] Test on different devices/browsers

## Testing Strategy

Each phase should be tested with:

1. Unit tests for core functions
2. Integration tests for API endpoints
3. End-to-end tests for user flows
4. Manual testing on different devices

## Monitoring & Debugging

- Add logging for:
  - Audio recording events
  - API calls and responses
  - Error states
- Monitor:
  - API response times
  - Audio quality metrics
  - Error rates

## Success Criteria

- Audio recording works reliably
- Classification results are accurate
- UI is responsive and intuitive
- Error handling is comprehensive
- History feature works as expected

## Non-Goals (Initial Implementation)

- User accounts
- Social sharing
- Offline mode
- Complex audio processing

## Database Schema (MongoDB)

```javascript
Bird {
  _id: ObjectId,
  name: String,          // Common name
  scientificName: String,
  description: Text,
  habitat: [String],
  range: [String],
  diet: [String],
  images: {
    primary: String,     // URL to main image
    additional: [String] // URLs to additional images
  },
  sounds: [{
    url: String,         // URL to sound file
    type: String,        // e.g., "call", "song"
    description: String
  }],
  metadata: {
    seasonalActivity: {
      spring: Boolean,
      summer: Boolean,
      autumn: Boolean,
      winter: Boolean
    },
    conservationStatus: String,
    averageSize: {
      length: Number,    // in cm
      wingspan: Number   // in cm
    }
  },
  modelInfo: {
    classLabel: String,  // Exact label used in Edge Impulse
    confidenceThreshold: Number
  },
  recognitionCount: { type: Number, default: 0 }  // Number of times this bird was recognized
}
```
