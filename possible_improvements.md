# Possible Future Improvements

## Audio Recording Enhancements

- Use Opus codec for better audio compression while maintaining quality
- Add configurable sample rates and bit depths
- Implement noise reduction algorithms specific to bird sounds
- Add audio normalization

## Visualization Features

- Add frequency spectrum analysis visualization
- Implement spectrogram view for better bird call analysis
- Add zoom functionality for detailed waveform inspection
- Add color themes for visualization

## Performance Optimizations

- Implement Web Workers for audio processing
- Add audio buffering for longer recordings
- Optimize canvas rendering for better performance
- Implement audio compression before upload

## User Experience

- Add recording quality indicators
- Implement audio preview before upload
- Add configurable recording duration
- Add visual markers for detected bird calls

These improvements would enhance the application but are not essential for the core functionality needed for this school project.
